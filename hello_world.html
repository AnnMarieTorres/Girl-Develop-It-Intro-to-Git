    <h1>Girl Develop It: Intro to Git</h1>
    <h2>Taught by David Brear</h2>
    <p>Version control allows you and your team to do several powerful things: collaborate, track, and revert changes.</p>
    <p>Git was created in 2005. It is fast, distributed, each commit has a corresponding hash, and everyone has a local copy of the history.</p>
    <h3>Installation and Setup:</h3>
    	<li>Make sure you have iterm or a similar commmand line tool.</li>
    	<li>Install git here: http://git-scm.com/</li>
    	<li>Configure your username and email, create your public/private keys.</li>

    <h3>You are now ready to create your first repo!</h3>
    <li>To creat a repo:</li>
    	<li>mkdir Name_of_folder</li>
    	<li>cd Name_of_folder</li>
    	<li>git init</li>

    <p>That's it, that's all there is to "git-ing" set up. Hehehe.</p>
